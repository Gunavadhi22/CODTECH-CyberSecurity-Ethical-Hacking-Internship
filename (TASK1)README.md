# Task 1: File Integrity Checker

This project is part of the CODTECH Cybersecurity Internship.

The File Integrity Checker is a Python tool that detects changes in files
by generating and comparing hash values using the hashlib library.

If the hash value changes, it indicates that the file has been modified.
This helps in identifying unauthorized or accidental file tampering.
